# around 68% of values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean. This is the
# expected result. Now the next part of the excercise:

# Now use the normal curve to describe the following belief. Suppose you
# believe that womenâ€™s heights follow a bell-shaped distribution, centered at
# 162cm with about two-thirds of all women having heights between 147cm and
# 177cm.

# This is described by a normal distribution with a mean of 1.62m.
# The difference between mean and lower bound is 0.15m
# The difference between mean and upper bound is 0.15m (fancy that!)
# The stanard deviation of this distribution should be 0.15m
